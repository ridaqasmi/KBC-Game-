Players accumulate winnings for each correct answer, with a chance to win up to 100,000 rupees.
Two lifelines are available: 'Help from Google' and the ability to quit the game.
The player's winnings are updated in real-time and saved in a virtual bank.
The game ends if the player answers incorrectly twice or chooses to quit the game.
The script handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides appropriate feedback.
